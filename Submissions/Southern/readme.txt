Project 1: Visualizing Anscombe's Quartet

I did not collaborate with anyone on this project.

The main resource I used to generate this code was the in class tutorial that we
completed (scatterTutorial.html). I used the following examples to help me with
various parts of this code:

For detecting mouse events: http://bl.ocks.org/WilliamQLiu/76ae20060e19bf42d774
To generate the line graph: https://gist.github.com/d3noob/402dd382a51a4f6eea487f9a35566de0
To generate side by side graphs: http://www.d3noob.org/2013/07/arranging-more-than-one-d3js-graph-on.html

I completed the "Replication" whistle. I used Tableau to replicate each of the
graphs I created (scatter2.png, line2.png, scatterALL.png). Since I am not
familiar with coding in JavaScript, it took me significantly less time to make
these graphs using Tableau. I simply had to select the data files, click
on "x" and "y", and use the "Show Me" feature in Tableau to generate the graphs.
It was very easy to choose the type of graph (scatter or line) and change the
color of the data points. I also edited the axes style and range to match those
of the graphs I generated with D3. However, I was not able to move the x and y
labels to the end of the axes as they are in D3 - they are centered along the
axes in Tableau.
